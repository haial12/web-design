   <p><h2>Synopsis : </h2></p>
   <p> <div style="text-align:justify;" >Tess is an Iraq War veteran and a recovering alcoholic, who has returned home to recover. She has a
    tense relationship with her sister, Beth. However, the two have temporarily reconciled to attend their
     little sister Rose's bachelorette party at the family farm. Tess only tolerates the company around her
      as she dislikes crowds and the people attending the party. To avoid trouble, Tess distances herself
       from the group and observes the caretakers of the house, sensing something is not quite right with 
       them. Beth thinks she's only making a fuss.

  Later that night, as the rest of the bachelorette party enjoy themselves with a male stripper, Tess goes 
  outside to be alone. Rose comes out to check on Tess, and when Beth also comes out, she gets angry seeing 
  Rose comforting Tess, thinking Tess is making everything about herself when Rose should actually be inside 
  enjoying her own bachelorette party. At this moment, attackers strike the women, killing Rose with a crossbow. 
  Tess brings Rose's body into the house, alarming the entire party. Confused, the women wonder what's happening 
  as the arrows continue to fly through the house, killing the stripper. As Tess is the only one trained for 
  combat, she commands everyone to help make the house dark, barricade themselves inside, and find a means to 
  call for help. </div ></p>
